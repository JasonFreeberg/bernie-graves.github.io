### About Me
Hello my name is Bernie Graves. I'm a Statistics and Data Science major at UCSB graduating in 2023. While I'm still relatively new to the field of data science, some of the topics I want to dive deeper into are sports analytics and natural language processing. Outside of school, I enjoy watching and playing basketball as well as gaming with some friends. Recently, I've gotten into cooking and while I'm no Gordon Ramsay, I've definetely expanded my reportoire past simple PB&J's. 

### Project Experience
My project experience consists of an NBA and WNBA final score predictor I worked on with a few friends from the UCSB Data Science Club. We used TensorFlow to build a model that given half time statistics would predict the final score. Our goal was to develop a model accurate enough to be with. Ultimately it was borderline successful when using the predictions to bet with. Below are some of the predictions it made.
